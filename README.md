# firescript

firescript is a statically and strongly typed programming language that compiles natively or to JavaScript + Wasm. It is designed to be simple, powerful, and easy to learn while remaining expressive for advanced applications.

*Disclaimer: firescript is currently in development and is not yet feature-complete. The language and compiler are subject to change. Not everything described in this document is implemented or working. Current builds may leak resources; the design goal is deterministic destruction via an ownership model.*

## Features

- **Static & Strong Typing:** Enhances code readability and reliability.
- **Simple Syntax:** Combines the best of C, Java, JavaScript, and Python.
- **Everything is Explicit:** No implicit conversions or hidden behavior.
- **Versatile Compilation:** Supports native binaries and JavaScript output.
- **Cohesive Design:** All parts of the language work seamlessly together.
- **Deterministic Ownership Model (planned):** Ownership, moves, borrows, and explicit cloning instead of a tracing garbage collector. See the [Memory Management Model](docs/reference/memory_management.md).

## Example

```firescript
// Define a function that returns the nth Fibonacci number
int8 fibonacci(int8 n) {
    if n <= 1 {
        return n
    }
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
}

// Print the first 10 Fibonacci numbers
for (int8 i : range(9)) {
    print(fibonacci(i))
}
```

## Benchmarks

### Recursive Fibonacci

Algorithm pseudo‑code:

```
function fibonacci(n) {
    if n <= 1 {
        return n
    }
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
}

fibonacci(47)
```

Fibonacci of 47 is used to provide a reasonable runtime for comparison. Test is run 5 times and the average time is reported.
Tests are run on an AMD Ryzen 7 5800H processor.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C Compiler (GCC recommended, but any C compiler should work as long as its location is in the CC environment variable)
- Python 3

### Installation

```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install gcc python3 libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev

# Fedora/RHEL/CentOS
sudo dnf install gcc python3 gmp-devel mpfr-devel

# Arch/Manjaro
sudo pacman -S gcc python3 gmp mpfr

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alec-jensen/firescript.git
cd firescript
```

### Compiling and Running a Program

```bash
# Compile a firescript program
python3 firescript/firescript.py program.fire

# Execute the compiled program
./output/program
```
