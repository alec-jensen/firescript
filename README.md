## Features

- Static & strong typing help to make code more readable, and less esoteric.
- Simple syntax makes it easy to learn and use, but able to support more complex and powerful features.
- Compiles to JavaScript for use in frontend applications, or natively for use in backend applications.
- Everything is designed to be cohesive and work together, so you can focus on writing code, not fighting with the language.

## Syntax

Firescript can best be described as Java, mixed with some JavaScript and Python. It inherits the robustness of Java, with syntax reminiscent of JavaScript, and quality of life features from Python.
