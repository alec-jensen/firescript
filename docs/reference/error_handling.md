# Runtime Error Handling

firescript is designed in a way that minimizes runtime errors through static type checking and compile-time validation. However, some errors may still occur during execution, such as division by zero or out-of-bounds array access.

## Error Types

1. **Syntax Errors**: Caught at compile-time, these errors occur when the code is not well-formed.
2. **Type Errors**: Also caught at compile-time, these occur when operations are applied to incompatible types.
3. **Runtime Errors**: These occur during execution and can include:
   - Division by zero
   - Null reference access
   - Array index out of bounds

## Error Handling

firescript provides a way to handle runtime errors gracefully:

- **Try/Catch Blocks**: You can wrap code that may throw an error in a try block, and handle the error in a catch block.

```firescript
try {
    int result = 10 / 0;
} catch (DivisionByZeroError e) {
    print("Error: " + e.message);
}
```

- **Assertions**: Use the `assert` function to check for conditions that must be true. If the condition is false, an error is raised.

```firescript
assert(x > 0, "x must be positive");
```

## Best Practices

- Always validate user input to prevent errors.
- Use try/catch blocks to handle potential runtime errors.
- Write unit tests to catch errors early in the development process.
